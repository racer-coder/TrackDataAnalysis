. save_state/restore_state on a bunch of dialogs.  make them more permanent?

* DETECT SECTIONS (STRAIGHT/CORNER/ETC) OR IMPORT FROM OTHER APP
. lat/long g force calculation from GPS? or internal accelerometers? or both?
. detection of braking/cornering based on exceeding threshold for a duration of time?

Later Milestones:

* MATHS

* KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

* OTHER WIDGETS
. bar graph
. steering wheel
. histogram
. fft
. scatter plot
. mixture/table
. channel report (customizable min/max/avg etc for customizable list of channels)

. don't recreate qmenu/qdialog/etc all the time? memory leak?
. better error handling - wrap many paint events and load/save actions in try/except that log errors somewhere and then hopefully continue without crashing
. open from db - ability to choose columns to display in results
. file format - megalogviewer
. file format - vbox
. data - close individual log file
. data - close all log files?
. data - opening new log file should not reset laps
. cython or mypyc for aim_xrk?
. time/dist detect whether should use meter vs feet depending on speed units?
. motec / non-gps - construct map from G-forces
. motec - special handling for status channels
. time/dist - in paintGraph, label channels even if no x_axis
. values dock - video playback can be choppy when values tab open - consider rendering values in a separate thread
. widgets - consider qpixmap cache for timedist graph and maps widget
. values dock - add/remove channel should scroll to keep selection in place?
. map - work as either dock or component
. map - save_state/load_state/ComponentManager integration for use as component
. map - drag map
. map - zoom map
. map - go back to orig placement
. periodic autosave of workspace?
. allow selection of workspace on startup
. multiple monitor/window support for workspaces
. improve channel search - CamelCase
. workbook popup menu - new, rename, delete, editor
. component widget - optional title bar
. component widget - make resize a little sticky when butting up against other components
. component widget - handle device scaling properly - proximity for mouse based resize
. component widget - click to drag only in upper left corner?
. component widget - maybe ctrl click or alt click to move/resize?
. keyboard shortcut for workspace selection
. keyboard shortcut ESC for closing floating dock widget
. keyboard shortcut for bringing up channels dock widget
. time/distance widget - vertical zoom bar to easily adjust range on the fly
. time/distance widget - resizable groups
. bar graph widget - title!
. bar graph widget - respond to channel messages
. bar graph widget - value. update with cursor
. bar graph widget - 2 graphs when comparing laps
. playback button with variable replay rate
. link g4+ - file reader
. layout dock widget? or skip in favor of dialog box
. video keyboard shortcuts for frame by frame, arrow keys for second/5s/10s?
. video change overall playback speed (good for machines that have a hard time playing two streams)
. video ability to disable either video for performance
. component widget - maximize option
