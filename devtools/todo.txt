* DETECT SECTIONS (STRAIGHT/CORNER/ETC) OR IMPORT FROM OTHER APP
. lat/long g force calculation from GPS? or internal accelerometers? or both?
. detection of braking/cornering based on exceeding threshold for a duration of time?

Later Milestones:

* MATHS
. math edit - UNITS
. math expression help - search for channels
. math expression help - search/help for functions
. math expression help - list possible units
. channels dock should show heirarchy for math/groups/etc separately from logged channels
. math - per-file expressions
. math - 2d/3d tables
. math - conditions on groups?
. math - better handling of expr that "overwrite" existing channels
. math - case insensitive channel loopup?

* KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

* OTHER WIDGETS
. bar graph
. steering wheel
. histogram
. fft
. scatter plot
. mixture/table
. channel report (customizable min/max/avg etc for customizable list of channels)

. values widget - sort should be case insensitive
. channels widget - sort should be case insensitive
. documentation - split among multiple files, add some pictures, quick start up front
. data widget - less forceful column resizing
. values widget - less forceful column resizing
. open from db - less forceful column resizing
. tech debt - better error handling - wrap many paint events and load/save actions in try/except that log errors somewhere and then hopefully continue without crashing
. tech debt - commit to using np.array for channel timecodes/values/etc to avoid rewrapping all the time
. open from db - ability to choose columns to display in results
. open - select fastest realistic lap, ignore abnormal laps
. file format - megalogviewer
. file format - vbox
. file format - racepak? might have encryption problem
. file format - link g4+
. motec / non-gps - construct map from G-forces
. motec - special handling for status channels
. widgets - consider qpixmap cache for timedist graph and maps widget
. values dock - add/remove channel should scroll to keep selection in place?
. values dock - video playback can be choppy when values tab open - consider rendering values in a separate thread
. map - work as either dock or component
. map - save_state/load_state/ComponentManager integration for use as component
. map - drag map
. map - zoom map
. map - go back to orig placement
. workspace - periodic autosave of workspace?
. workspace - allow selection of workspace on startup
. workspace - multiple monitor/window support for workspaces
. workspace - workbook popup menu - new, rename, delete, editor
. component widget - optional title bar
. component widget - make resize a little sticky when butting up against other components
. component widget - handle device scaling properly - proximity for mouse based resize
. component widget - click to drag only in upper left corner?
. component widget - maybe ctrl click or alt click to move/resize?
. component widget - maximize option
. keyboard shortcut for workspace selection
. keyboard shortcut ESC for closing floating dock widget
. keyboard shortcut for bringing up channels dock widget
. time/dist - in paintGraph, label channels even if no x_axis
. time/dist detect whether should use meter vs feet depending on speed units?
. time/distance widget - vertical zoom bar to easily adjust range on the fly
. time/distance widget - resizable groups
. time/distance widget - proper clipping of graphs (left edge can wander into axis)
. bar graph widget - title!
. bar graph widget - respond to channel messages
. bar graph widget - value. update with cursor
. bar graph widget - 2 graphs when comparing laps
. playback button with variable replay rate
. video - keyboard shortcuts for frame by frame, arrow keys for second/5s/10s?
. video - change overall playback speed (good for machines that have a hard time playing two streams)
. video - ability to disable either video for performance
. ui - more consistent/sane font choices: bigger fonts for everything but axis labels
. ui - mac font sizes too small?
